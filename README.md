# Portfolio-2019

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e6638eba-be6f-4f36-818b-491b1ca72e90/deploy-status)](https://trevorkirpaul.com)

This is the repo for my personal site which mainly showcases how I prefer to build React apps and will hopefully serve as a great example app for new developers who are looking for a larger codebase.

## Prerequisites

- Node (see [nvmrc](./.nvmrc) for version)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## ToDo

- [x] implement theming via `styled-components`
- [x] add changelog
- [ ] add comments for all interfaces
- [ ] add developer facing docs
- [x] implement storybook

## Storybook

You can run storybook using `yarn storybook` which will start a storybook instance on port `9009`.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a visual testing library and basically allows you to sandbox components in different states. This is a great way to test how your components are rendering and is essential during development.

## Changes

To see and up to date changelog, click [here](./CHANGELOG.md). This document is based on the deployed production site but also contains "unreleased" changes from lower environments.
